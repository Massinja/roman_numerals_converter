# Welcome to My Roman Numerals Converter
***

## Task
Write a function to convert numbers to Roman Numerals.

## Description

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M.  
(Notice these letters have lots of straight lines and are hence easy to carve into stone tablets)

The program doesn't convert numbers larger than 3000.  
(The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

## Usage
```
ruby roman_converter.rb 2476
Output: 2476 => MMCDLXXVI
```
